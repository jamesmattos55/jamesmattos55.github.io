# Elevator Pitch
<    My name is James Mattos, i'm a junior android developer and I want to make useful apps
  to make peoples lives easier, and to help anyone who needs a mobile application, whether its
  for a company or personal use. Thank you for your time that you took reading this, and I hope 
  you will contact me for a meeting if you ever need an honest, hard-working mobile developer. />

  <  I chose these pictures out of many random others, as I thought they are an accurate representation
  of where I feel I am in life, and where I want to be, respectively.
    The first photo is of two Marine Corps color gaurds, walking through what seems to be a green neighborhood
  of some sort. While it may seem like a stretch, I see my self as these Men because I too am in the military, and 
  in the photo it seems that they are out of place in their surrounding. While I dont feel completely lost in
  my current situation, I do feel like I am trekking into unfamilliar territory and through it all, I am going
  to stick to what I know and keep marching onward.
    The latter photo is where I want to be. Now at first glance it may not seem like much, or even somewhat pathetic
  of a goal to have. But thats not what I see. In the photo I see a group of expierenced workers who have gotten
  to the point where they can enjoy themselves and are confident in their wisdom and abilities to achieve
  their goal. />
